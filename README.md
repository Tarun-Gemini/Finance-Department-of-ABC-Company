Dealing with invoices of payroll vendors and cost associated with generating payslips for their employees

Business Case: 
The Finance Department of ABC Company maintains the invoice level details of all Payroll vendors and the cost associated with generating payslips for their employees. The Analyst receives invoices for each vendor and he fills all the details from each invoice in an excel sheet. He along with his colleagues collects similar data for all the countries and collates that information in one spreadsheet. The Global Finance leader along with other Country-level Finance leaders seeks data from these analysts to identify the Per Payslip Costs (PPC), that helps them in negotiating with vendors to reduce overall cost for the company.
